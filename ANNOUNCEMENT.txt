Subject: Kiro Emacs System - Central Prompt Queue & Multi-Instance Dashboard

Greetings,

We've completed a major milestone in the Kiro Emacs integration project:

## 🚀 NEW: Central Prompt Queue

Never miss a shell prompt again! All prompts from all shells (local AND remote 
Emacs instances) now appear in one central queue:

  M-x kiro-prompt-queue

Features:
- Shows last 20 lines of context per prompt
- Batch operations: answer 'y' or 'n' to ALL prompts at once
- Jump directly to any waiting shell
- Auto-detects [y/n] prompts and questions
- Works across multiple Emacs instances via tunnel

## 📊 Enhanced Dashboard

Real-time monitoring of your entire Kiro system:

  M-x kiro-dashboard

Shows:
- Service status (spool, jobs, time)
- Tunnel peers (all connected Emacs instances)
- Shell buffers with status (RUNNING/STOPPED, ⚠WAIT indicator)
- Query jobs and cache stats
- Press RET on any line to jump to that buffer

## 🔗 Multi-Emacs Tunnel

Connect multiple Emacs instances seamlessly:
- Automatic peer discovery
- Message passing between instances
- Remote shell monitoring
- Distributed prompt queue

## 📦 Installation

  cd ~/.emacs.d/kiro.el
  ./setup-emacs.sh

Or:
  git clone https://github.com/meta-introspector/kiro.el ~/.emacs.d/kiro.el
  
Then add to ~/.emacs:
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/kiro.el")
  (load-file "~/.emacs.d/kiro.el/kiro.el")

## 🎯 Quick Demo

  # Start service
  ~/.emacs.d/kiro.el/kiro-service.sh start
  
  # In Emacs
  M-x kiro-dashboard    ; View system status
  M-x kiro-prompt-queue ; Manage all prompts

## 📋 Key Features

1. Central Prompt Queue - All shell prompts in one place
2. Multi-Emacs Coordination - Connect multiple instances
3. Smart Detection - Auto-detect waiting shells
4. Batch Operations - Answer all prompts at once
5. Real-time Monitoring - Live dashboard updates
6. Buffer Navigation - Jump anywhere with RET
7. ITIL Service Management - Professional ops tools
8. Formal Verification - Lean4 proofs included

## 🧪 Testing

- ERT test suite: 7 tests passing
- Nix build: Reproducible builds
- Lean4 proofs: Verified correctness
- Service health checks: Automated monitoring

## 📚 Documentation

See ~/.emacs.d/kiro.el/README*.md for:
- Dashboard usage
- Prompt queue commands
- Service management
- Tunnel setup

## 💡 Use Cases

- Manage multiple long-running processes
- Never miss approval prompts
- Coordinate work across Emacs instances
- Monitor distributed workflows
- Batch-answer deployment confirmations
- Track shell status in real-time

This represents a significant step toward distributed Emacs workflows and 
intelligent prompt management.

Feedback welcome!
